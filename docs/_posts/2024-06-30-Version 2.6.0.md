We are excited to announce the release of SlideIO version 2.6.0, an update to our open-source library for pathology image analysis. This latest version adds support PerkinElmer Vectra QPTIF.

To help you get started with these new capabilities, we have prepared a comprehensive tutorial that demonstrates the usage of the library. The tutorial, available at our GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/Booritas/slideio-tutorial), provides step-by-step instructions and code samples to guide you through the process of reading pathology image analysis workflows.
