We are thrilled to announce the release of SlideIO version 2.0.2! This version comes with two new features that improve the performance and functionality of the library when working with DICOM images.

Firstly, SlideIO 2.0.2 includes a significant performance improvement for loading DICOM images. This improvement ensures that DICOM images load faster and more efficiently, which is particularly beneficial for applications processing multiple DICOM images simultaneously.

Secondly, a new function has been added to expose scene metadata for DICOM images. The function returns a JSON array with DICOM tags, providing more detailed information about the DICOM image. This feature enhances the functionality of SlideIO and allows users to gain greater insight into the DICOM images they are working with.

SlideIO version 2.0.2 is available for Linux, Windows, and MacOS operating systems with x86_64 processors.

At SlideIO, we are committed to providing reliable and efficient solutions for working with digital pathology and DICOM images. We will continue to work on improving the library and adding support for new formats in future releases. Thank you for your continued support and feedback.
