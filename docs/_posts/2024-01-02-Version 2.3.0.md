We are excited to announce the release of SlideIO version 2.3.0, an update to our open-source library for pathology image analysis. This latest version improves reading of Hammamatsu NDPI images.

Slideio 2.3.0 release is focused on improvement of performance of NDPI drivers. The driver now uses restart markers to read regions of large JPEG images. 

To help you get started with these new capabilities, we have prepared a comprehensive tutorial that demonstrates the usage of the library. The tutorial, available at our GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/Booritas/slideio-tutorial), provides step-by-step instructions and code samples to guide you through the process of reading pathology image analysis workflows.
