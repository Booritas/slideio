SlideIO 2.0.1 includes improved drivers for these tiff-based formats, resulting in faster and more efficient performance when handling Aperio SVS and Leica SCN images. This improvement is particularly beneficial for applications that need to process multiple images simultaneously.

SlideIO version 2.0.1 is available for Linux, Windows, and MacOS operating systems with x86_64 processors.
At SlideIO, we are committed to providing reliable and efficient solutions for working with digital pathology images. We will continue to work on improving the library and adding support for new formats in future releases. Thank you for your continued support and feedback.
