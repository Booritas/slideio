We are excited to announce the release of version 2.0.6 of the SlideIO library. This latest version contains several new features and improvements, including a fix to an issue with reading images located on non-ASCII paths.

With this new version, users can now specify "AUTO" instead of a driver name in the open_slide method, which will automatically select the appropriate driver for the given file format. This makes it much easier for users who are not familiar with the various drivers available in the library to get started with SlideIO.

In addition to these improvements, version 2.0.6 also includes several bug fixes and performance optimizations, which will help to make the library even more reliable and efficient.

We encourage all users to upgrade to this latest version to take advantage of these new features and improvements. As always, we welcome your feedback and suggestions for future development.

Thank you for your continued support and use of SlideIO.
