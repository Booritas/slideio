We are excited to announce the release of SlideIO Library version 2.0.8, a maintenance release that includes important updates and fixes to enhance the functionality and performance of the library.
One significant fix in this release is related to the DICOM driver, which previously encountered issues when processing directories with files that belong to whole slide image (WSI) DICOM slides. In the new version, a scene object will be created for each DICOM file, ensuring accurate handling of DICOM images.

We acknowledge the inconvenience this may have caused, and we have taken steps to rectify this issue. Furthermore, we are actively working towards adding proper handling of WSI DICOM images as a single multiresolution image in future updates, further improving the library's capabilities.

As always, we greatly appreciate your feedback and support in helping us continually improve the SlideIO Library. We recommend upgrading to the latest version (2.0.8) to benefit from the fixed DICOM driver and other enhancements.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us. Thank you for your continued support.
