We are excited to announce the release of SlideIO version 2.0.4! This version comes with an improvement in memory consumption for tiff-based images, specifically Aperio SVS and Leica SCN.

With the latest version of SlideIO, we have implemented improvements in memory consumption for tiff-based images, specifically Aperio SVS and Leica SCN. These improvements enable the library to load and handle these images more efficiently, resulting in better performance for applications that use SlideIO.

SlideIO version 2.0.4 is available for Linux, Windows, and MacOS operating systems with x86_64 processors.

In addition to the memory consumption improvement, SlideIO version 2.0.4 also includes bug fixes and other enhancements. We encourage all users to upgrade to this latest version to take advantage of these improvements and ensure the best performance for their applications.

At SlideIO, we are committed to providing reliable and efficient solutions for working with digital pathology images. We will continue to work on improving the library and adding support for new formats in future releases. Thank you for your continued support and feedback.
