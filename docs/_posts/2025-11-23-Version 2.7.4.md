We are pleased to announce the maintenance release of SlideIO **version 2.7.4**, an update to our open‑source library for pathology image analysis.

This release includes an important [fix for parsing VSI z‑stack metadata](https://github.com/Booritas/slideio/issues/52), improving the robustness and accuracy of SlideIO when working with Olympus VSI files. The updated metadata handling ensures more reliable access to z‑stack information, which is critical for quantitative and 3D pathology workflows.

It provides:

- Step‑by‑step instructions for setting up and using SlideIO  
- Code examples for reading and working with whole slide images  
- Example workflows relevant to pathology image analysis

We welcome your feedback and issue reports on GitHub and appreciate your continued support of the SlideIO project.
