We are pleased to announce the release of SlideIO Library version 2.0.7. This maintenance release includes a bug fix that addresses the issue of opening NDPI files with non-ASCII symbols in the file path.

Previously, users encountered difficulties when trying to open NDPI files with file paths that contained non-ASCII symbols, such as special characters or non-English characters. This bug has now been resolved in SlideIO Library version 2.0.7, allowing seamless access to NDPI files regardless of the presence of non-ASCII symbols in the file path.
